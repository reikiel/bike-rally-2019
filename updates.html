          Good evening everyone,<br>
          <br>
          We are back with more updates regarding Bike Rally 2019!<br>
          <br>
          Introducing to you, our 2 distances for Bike Rally 2019: 118KM & 178KM.<br>
          <br>
          'Wait what? 118KM?' Some of you might ask. But that's right! We have indeed increased the distance for one of our route; from 108KM to 118KM.<br>
          <br>
          This increase is in hope for our participants to better challenge themselves and push their limits. Ultimately, hoping that all cyclists will have a memorable ride with us!<br>
          <br>
          We hope that everyone is ready and up for the challenge, see you there at Bike Rally 2019!<br>
          <br>
